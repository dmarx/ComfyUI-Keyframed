# ComfyUI-Keyframed

ðŸš§ Work In Progress ðŸš§ - ComfyUI nodes to facilitate value keyframing by providing an interface for using [keyframed](https://github.com/dmarx/keyframed) in ComfyUI workflows.


...Open question: if I make this, what will differentiate it from https://github.com/FizzleDorf/ComfyUI_FizzNodes ?

* easier curve composition
* easier to change interpolators/easing functions

# Philosophy

Curves, interpolators, and keyframes are objects that can be passed around, plugged and unplugged, and interchanged.
