# ComfyUI-Keyframed

ðŸš§ Work In Progress ðŸš§ - ComfyUI nodes to facilitate value keyframing by providing an interface for using [keyframed](https://github.com/dmarx/keyframed) in ComfyUI workflows.

# Overview

**Philosophy**

* Treat curves/schedules and keyframes as objects that can be passed around, plugged and unplugged, interchanged, and manipulated atomically.
* Leverage nodes to facilitate modularity and flexibility.
* Facilitate fast iteration
* Provide convenience functions for most common use cases, and also low-leverl operators capable of reproducing the behavior of those convenience functions to permit user customization in "node space".


# Starter Workflows

## Prompt Scheduling

![Prompt Scheduling](examples/prompt-scheduling.png)

 This one is probably why you are here. This workflow demonstrates how to use the `keyframed/schedule` nodes to achieve similar behavior as [FizzNodes'](https://github.com/FizzleDorf/ComfyUI_FizzNodes) **PromptSchedule** node, but implemented differently.

This schedule is essentailly a normal AnimateDiff workflow where several nodes have replaced the normal conditioning setup. Rather than a single `CLIP Text Encode` node, we can have multiple prompts which transition sequentially over time. For documentation detailing how this workflow works, see the [`Nodes > Scheduling`](https://github.com/dmarx/ComfyUI-Keyframed/blob/dev/README.md#scheduling) section below.

## Prompt Interleaving (aka Prompt Entanglement, aka Prompt Superposition)

# Nodes

## Curve Constructors

### Curve From String

![Curve From String](assets/node_curve-from-string.png)


### Curve From YAML

### Constant-Valued Curve

![Curve From YAML](assets/node_constant-valued-curve.png)


### Entangled Curves

![Entangled Curves](assets/nodes_entangled.png)

Each output curve of the node is a sine wave that oscillates from `0` to `1` at the given frequency or wavelength. The outputs of a given node are phase-offset such that at any given time, the sum of the generated curves is `1`. 

Reference the [Prompt Interleaving Workflow](https://github.com/dmarx/ComfyUI-Keyframed/blob/dev/README.md#prompt-interleaving-aka-prompt-entanglement-aka-prompt-superposition) for a demonstrative example.

## Curve Operators

### Evaluate Curve At T

### Apply Curve To Conditioning

### Add Conditions

### Curve Arithmetic Operators

NB: the division operator is unreliable at the time of this writing (2023-12-09).


## Scheduling

These nodes work together to facilitate transitioning through a sequence of conditionings (i.e. prompts). We'll call this sequence the "schedule" of the conditionings. The primary use case here is for manipulating the positive prompt, i.e. for building a "prompt schedule". Given a particular time (e.g. frame id) in an animation seuquence, we can query the prompt schedule at that time to get the appropriate conditioning to pass to the KSampler.
